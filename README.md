# Multiplex PCR Primer Designer (v7.9)

This is a powerful, fully-automated command-line tool for designing robust, multiplex-ready PCR primer panels for amplicon-based next-generation sequencing.

It is an end-to-end solution that takes a genome, a list of gene targets, and produces a final, validated, and sequencing-ready primer list. It features an advanced **3'-end stability checker** to eliminate false-positive clashes, a **robust GFF parser** to find genes, an **intelligent auto-pooling engine**, and a novel **iterative clamp-design feature** for self-folding hairpin primers.

## Core Features

* **Advanced Oligo Formatting (v7.0):** Toggle output between "template" (`rc_tailed`) and "synthesis-ready" (`fwd_tailed`) formats.
* **Iterative Hairpin Clamping (v7.0):** (Optional) When in "synthesis-ready" mode, iteratively adds a 5' clamp to create a self-folding hairpin primer, calibrated to a specific stem stability ($\Delta G$).
* **Intelligent 3'-End Stability Logic (v5.1):** Replaces "dumb" dimer/hairpin checks. It *only* flags biochemically problematic 3'-extendable interactions, dramatically reducing false positives and enabling larger, more efficient pools.
* **Robust GFF Parsing (v6.3):** The GFF parser now robustly searches for gene identifiers under `Name=`, `gene=`, and `locus_tag=` attributes, maximizing target-finding success.
* **Advanced Auto-Pooling (v4.3):** Automatically detects if amplicons are "sparse" or "tiled" (overlapping). For tiled designs, or by default, it finds the *minimum number of compatible pools* (N-pools) required to achieve a perfect, 0-clash design.
* **Multi-Copy Gene Support (v6.0):** Use the `--force-multiprime` flag to design primers for multi-copy genes (like 16S rRNA) where a single BLAST hit isn't expected or desired.
* **Configurable Auto-Healer (v6.2):** The `find_compatible_set` algorithm iteratively swaps primers to resolve clashes. The number of attempts is configurable via `--max-compatibility-iterations`.
* **Smart Retry Logic (v6.2):** The script first attempts to design primers using a strict, "ideal" set of parameters (e.g., "tight at 60C"). If it fails, it automatically retries with a list of more relaxed fallback strategies.
* **Parallel Processing:** Uses all available CPU cores to design primers for large panels quickly.
* **Tail-Only Mode:** A utility to bypass all design logic and simply add adapter tails to a pre-existing primer list, respecting the chosen `--oligo-format`.
* **Comprehensive Output:** Generates a `.csv` for ordering, a `.bed` for IGV visualization, and a `.log.txt` for traceability.

## Workflow Logic (v7.7)

The script's automated decision-making follows this path. The (optional) hairpin clamp logic is a post-processing step applied to primers that pass the `E` check.

## Usage

The script operates in two main modes, which it selects based on the arguments you provide.

### Mode 1: Full Design Pipeline

This is the main, fully-automated mode. It designs, validates, and tails primers from scratch.

**Required Arguments:**
* `--genome`: Path to your reference genome (FASTA format).
* `--gff`: Path to your gene annotation file (GFF format).
* `--target-file`: Path to a simple `.txt` file with one gene ID per line.
* `--blast-db`: A prefix for your BLAST database (e.g., "ecoli_db"). The script will automatically build this database from your genome if it doesn't exist.

**Optional Arguments:**
* `--output-prefix`: (Default: `final_primers`) A prefix for your output files.
* `--oligo-format [rc_tailed | fwd_tailed]`: (Default: `rc_tailed`).
    * `rc_tailed`: "Template" format. Outputs the reverse-complement of the primer + the long `FWD_RC_P5_TRUNCATED` tail.
    * `fwd_tailed`: "Synthesis-ready" format. Outputs the forward primer + the `FWD_P5_TRUNCATED` tail.
* `--add-hairpin-clamp`: (Default: False) Iteratively adds a 5' clamp to create a self-folding hairpin. **Requires `--oligo-format "fwd_tailed"`.**
* `--force-single-pool`: Forces the script to find the "best-available" set for a single tube. *Only used for sparse (non-overlapping) designs.*
* `--force-multiprime`: (v6.0) Allows primers that hit multiple locations (e.g., 16S rRNA). Default is strict single-hit specificity.
* `--max-compatibility-iterations`: (v6.0) Maximum iterations for the auto-healing algorithm. (Default: 100).

#### Example 1: Standard Run (Template Format)
This command generates the "template" oligos using the default `rc_tailed` format.

```
python .\design_v7.7.py --genome "ecoli_genome.fna" --gff "genomic.gff" --target-file "target_genes.txt" --blast-db "ecoli_db" --output-prefix "my_panel_template"
```

#### Example 2: Hairpin Clamp Run (Synthesis Format)
This command generates the synthesis-ready, self-folding hairpin primers.

```
python .\design_v7.7.py --genome "ecoli_genome.fna" --gff "genomic.gff" --target-file "housekeeping_genes.txt" --blast-db "ecoli_db" --output-prefix "housekeeping_genes_hairpins" --oligo-format "fwd_tailed" --add-hairpin-clamp
```

---

### Mode 2: Tail-Only Utility

This mode bypasses all design and validation. It simply takes existing primer lists and adds your hardcoded sequencing tails, respecting the `--oligo-format` flag.

**Example Command (Synthesis-Ready):**
```
python .\design_v7.7.py --tail-fwd-file "my_fwd_primers.txt" --tail-rev-file "my_rev_primers.txt" --output-prefix "my_tailed_primers_synthesis" --oligo-format "fwd_tailed"
```

---

## Understanding the Output

The script generates three files for each design or pool:

**1. The `.csv` File (The "Order Sheet")**
This is your main result file. Key columns include:
* **`target_id`**: The gene symbol for this primer pair.
* **`pair_rank`**: The Primer3 quality score (e.g., `0 (Strategy 0 (Ideal))` is the best primer).
* **`flags`**: **(IMPORTANT)**
    * `OK`: Passed all ideal checks.
    * `Low_Tm` / `High_Tm`: Tm is outside the `IDEAL_TM_MIN/MAX` range (from a fallback strategy).
    * `HairpinClamp`: The `--add-hairpin-clamp` logic was successfully applied.
    * `Multi_Hit...`: `--force-multiprime` was used and the primer hit >1 location.
* **`fwd_primer_tailed` / `rev_primer_tailed`**: The final oligo sequence. Its content depends entirely on the `--oligo-format` and `--add-hairpin-clamp` flags.
* **`fwd_primer_seq` / `rev_primer_seq`**: The 20-mer target-specific sequence, *without* any tails or clamps.
* **`fwd_primer_tm` / `rev_primer_tm`**: The $T_m$ of the *target-specific* sequence.
* **`specificity_hits`**: The BLAST result. `F:1, R:1` is the ideal (unless using `--force-multiprime`).

**2. The `.bed` File (The "Visual Check")**
* Load your reference genome (`.fna`) into a genome browser (like **IGV**), then load this `.bed` file to visually confirm your amplicon locations.

**3. The `.log.txt` File (The "Traceability Log")**
* Contains a full record of the design process.
* Lists all targets that failed the initial design.
* Lists any final compatibility warnings if `--force-single-pool` was used.

## Design Constants & Customization

The following constants at the top of the script are the primary way to fine-tune the design logic.

```python
# --- (v7.7) Refactored Hardcoded Adapter Tails ---
# For 'fwd_tailed' (synthesis-ready) format
FWD_P5_TRUNCATED = 'ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT'
REV_P7_TRUNCATED = 'GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT'
# For 'rc_tailed' (template-generation) format
FWD_RC_P5_TRUNCATED = 'AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT'
REV_RC_P7_TRUNCATED = 'AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC'


# --- Design Constants ---
END_STABILITY_DG_THRESHOLD = -9.0
IDEAL_TM_MIN = 59.0
IDEAL_TM_MAX = 61.0

# --- Large-Panel Logic ---
MAX_CLASH_RECOMMENDATION = 5
MAX_COMPATIBILITY_ITERATIONS = 100

# --- (v7.7) Constants for Hairpin Clamp Logic ---
# Calibrated value from user tests (v7.6) to match IDT's calculator.
HAIRPIN_STEM_TARGET_DG = -12.5 # (kcal/mol) The target dG for the *stem* interaction
HAIRPIN_CLAMP_MAX_LEN = 15     # Max bases to add

# Primer3 global arguments are set within design_primers_for_sequence.
# These define the initial target parameters for Primer3.
# Important parameters here (refer to Primer3 documentation for full list):
# 'PRIMER_OPT_SIZE': 20,         # Target primer length
# 'PRIMER_MIN_SIZE': 19,         # Minimum primer length
# 'PRIMER_MAX_SIZE': 22,         # Maximum primer length
# 'PRIMER_OPT_TM': 60.0,         # Primer3 actively tries to design primers with this Tm
# 'PRIMER_MIN_GC': 40.0,         # Minimum GC content percentage
# 'PRIMER_MAX_GC': 60.0,         # Maximum GC content percentage
# 'PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE': [[150, 250]], # Default amplicon size range
# 'PRIMER_NUM_RETURN': 20        # Number of primer pairs Primer3 attempts to return per sequence
```

The `strategies` list, defined within the `process_single_target` function, provides sequential alternative parameter sets for Primer3 to try if the initial attempt fails. Modifying these allows you to define a precise retry logic:

```python
# --- Inside process_single_target function ---
    # 1. Define Retry Strategies
    strategies = [
        # Strategy 0: Your primary, tightest attempt, using the IDEAL Tms
        {'PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE': [[150, 250]], 'PRIMER_MIN_TM': IDEAL_TM_MIN, 'PRIMER_MAX_TM': IDEAL_TM_MAX}, 
        # Strategy 1: Longer product size range, with slightly relaxed Tms from the ideal
        {'PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE': [[250, 350]], 'PRIMER_MIN_TM': 57.0, 'PRIMER_MAX_TM': 63.0}, 
        # Strategy 2: Shorter product size range, with slightly relaxed Tms from the ideal
        {'PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE': [[100, 150]], 'PRIMER_MIN_TM': 57.0, 'PRIMER_MAX_TM': 63.0}, 
        # Strategy 3: Default product size, but with the most relaxed Tm range
        {'PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE': [[150, 250]], 'PRIMER_MIN_TM': 55.0, 'PRIMER_MAX_TM': 65.0}, 
    ]
```

## Understanding TM & Stability Settings

* **`IDEAL_TM_MIN` / `IDEAL_TM_MAX` (e.g., 59.0-61.0):** These serve a dual purpose:
    1.  They set the **strict boundaries for Strategy 0**, the "ideal" design.
    2.  They act as the **flagging threshold**. Any primer designed by a *fallback strategy* (e.g., with a Tm of 57°C) will receive a `Low_Tm` flag in the final CSV.
* **`PRIMER_OPT_TM` (inside `design_primers_for_sequence`):** This is set to **`60.0`**. This is the exact $T_m$ Primer3 will try to achieve during Strategy 0.
* **`END_STABILITY_DG_THRESHOLD`:** This is the *filter* to reject primers. It checks the 3' end of the *specific primer sequence* to prevent 3'-extendable primer-dimers.
* **`HAIRPIN_STEM_TARGET_DG`:** This is the *target* for the iterative clamp builder. It uses `primer3.calc_heterodimer` to model the stem (clamp + 3' end of primer) to achieve this dG. This value (`-12.5`) is calibrated to produce final oligos with a $\Delta G$ of ~-14 kcal/mol in external calculators.

## Categorizing Difficult-to-Target Genes (and Why They Are So):

### Category 1: Multi-Copy Genes (The Specificity Problem)

These genes fail because they exist in multiple, often identical, copies throughout the genome. Your script's BLAST check (`fwd_hits == 1 and rev_hits == 1`) correctly identifies this.

* **Problem:** A primer designed for `rrsD` will also bind to `rrsA`, `rrsB`, `rrsC`, etc. This results in `fwd_hits = 7`.
* **Examples from Your List:**
    * **rRNA Genes:** `rrlB`, `rrlD` (23S rRNA), `rrsD` (16S rRNA).
    * **tRNA Genes:** `argL`, `argY`, `glnX`, `gltV`, `glyT`, `leuT`, `lysV`, `proM`, `tyrU`, `valT`.
    * **Insertion Sequences (Mobile DNA):** `insC5`, `insE5`, `insF1`, `insF5`, `insH21`, `insH7`.
    * **Repetitive Elements:** `rhsB` (RHS element).
* **How to "Fix" (If You Must):** This is what the `--force-multiprime` flag is for. If you *want* to amplify all 7 copies of the 16S gene, you would use this flag. For beta testing, you should **avoid these genes** to confirm your single-copy specificity logic is working.

---

### Category 2: Highly Structured Genes (The 3'-End Stability Problem)

This is the **exact reason `ileV` failed** in your previous run, and why many of these are failing now.

* **Problem:** These genes encode functional RNAs (like tRNA) or regulatory elements. Their DNA sequence is *designed* to be self-complementary so the final RNA product can fold into complex, stable shapes. This means any 20-base primer you pick from this sequence has a very high chance of being able to fold back on itself, forming a stable 3'-extendable hairpin or self-dimer.
* **How the Script Catches It:** The script *does* find primer pairs, but every single one of them fails this check: `worst_self_interaction_dg < END_STABILITY_DG_THRESHOLD` (i.e., the 3' end is more stable than -9.0 kcal/mol).
* **Examples from Your List:**
    * **All the tRNA genes again:** `ileV` (which you saw fail), `argL`, `glyT`, etc.
    * **Leader Peptides/Attenuators:** `hisL`, `ilvX`, `leuL`, `pheM`, `tnaC`, `thrL`, `trpL`. These are regulatory regions that form complex hairpins to control gene expression.
    * **Small Regulatory RNAs (sRNA):** `ibsB`, `ibsC`, `tisB`, `rirA`. These are *defined* by their complex secondary structures.
* **How to "Fix" (NOT Recommended):** You would have to make your `END_STABILITY_DG_THRESHOLD` much more relaxed (e.g., `-15.0`). This is a **bad idea**, as you would be approving primers that are almost *guaranteed* to fail in the lab by forming dimers instead of amplifying their target.

---

### Category 3: Very Short Genes (The "No Room" Problem)

* **Problem:** The entire gene is shorter than your *minimum* allowed amplicon size (e.g., 100-150 bp). `primer3` can't find a place to put two primers *and* have a 100+ bp product in the middle.
* **Examples from Your List:**
    * Many leader peptides (`hisL`, `trpL`) are tiny (e.g., 20-50 bp long).
    * Many small regulatory RNAs (`tisB`) are also very short.
    * `y-genes` (uncharacterized) are often just short, predicted open reading frames.
* **How the Script Catches It:** The script tries all 4 strategies, and the `seq_len < min_product_size` pre-check skips the impossible ones. For the strategies that *are* possible (e.g., `[100, 150]` on a 120 bp gene), `primer3` often fails to find a pair that *also* meets the strict Tm and 3'-end stability rules in such a small space.
* **How to "Fix":** You would have to add a new, "ultra-short" strategy (e.g., `PRIMER_PRODUCT_SIZE_RANGE: [[50, 80]]`). This is generally not recommended unless you are specifically designing for very short targets.

---

## Advice for Beta Testing (How to Avoid These)

For your beta testing, you want to build confidence with "easy" targets. You should pick genes that are:

1.  **Single-Copy:** Avoid all `rrs`, `rrl`, `trn` (tRNA), and `ins` (insertion) genes.
2.  **Protein-Coding (not RNA):** Avoid leader peptides (`...L`) and sRNAs (`ibsB`, `tisB`).
3.  **Reasonably Long:** Stick to genes that are **> 300 bp** long. This gives `primer3` plenty of room to find good primers.
4.  **"Average" GC Content:** Avoid genes known to be in extremely A/T-rich or G/C-rich regions of the genome.

The provided list of 21 housekeeping genes (`gyrB`, `recA`, `rpoD`, `gapA`, `ftsZ`, `mdh`, `gyrA`, `adk`, etc.) is the *perfect* "easy" list for beta testing.
